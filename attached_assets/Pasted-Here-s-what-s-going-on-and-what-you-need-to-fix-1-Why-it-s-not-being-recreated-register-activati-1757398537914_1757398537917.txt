Here’s what’s going on and what you need to fix:

1. Why it’s not being recreated

register_activation_hook() only fires when the plugin is activated from the WordPress admin Plugins page.

But in your plugin you are hiding the plugin from the Plugins page (all_plugins filter). That means you never actually “activate” it via admin, so the activate() method (where you schedule your cron) is never called again after reinstall.

Deleting the plugin files and re-uploading doesn’t trigger activation either — unless WordPress explicitly re-runs the activation routine.

Result: after you deleted the cron event manually, nothing schedules it again.

2. How to fix

You need to ensure the cron is always (re)registered, even if activation hook is skipped. You can do this in init (or plugins_loaded) instead of relying only on register_activation_hook.

Example fix:

public function init() {
    // Register custom interval
    add_filter('cron_schedules', array($this, 'add_cron_interval'));

    // Ensure event is scheduled if missing
    if (!wp_next_scheduled($this->cron_hook)) {
        wp_schedule_event(time(), 'every_minute', $this->cron_hook);
        error_log('Analytics 4.0: Cron event auto-rescheduled from init');
    }
}


This way, even if you reinstall or clear events, WP will recreate the schedule as soon as the plugin runs.

3. Clean up your aggressive cleanup

You have this in aggressive_cron_cleanup():

$timestamps = wp_get_scheduled_event($this->cron_hook);
if ($timestamps) {
    foreach ((array)$timestamps as $timestamp) {
        wp_unschedule_event($timestamp, $this->cron_hook);
    }
}


⚠️ wp_get_scheduled_event() returns a single event object (not an array of timestamps). Looping over it won’t work as intended.
Instead, use wp_unschedule_hook($this->cron_hook) which removes all instances at once.

4. Suggested minimal changes

Keep register_activation_hook() for first-time installs.

Add auto-rescheduling check in init() as above.

Replace your manual looping cleanup with:

wp_unschedule_hook($this->cron_hook);


✅ After this, even if you delete the event or reinstall, your plugin will auto-create the cron event the next time WP runs init.
